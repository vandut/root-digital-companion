The mighty Marquise de Cat wants to industrialize the woods, the aristocratic Eyrie Dynasties seek to reclaim their lost kingdom, and the rebellious Woodland Alliance aims to unite the creatures against the invaders. Understanding your faction\'s strengths and your opponents\' weaknesses is key to victory.'
