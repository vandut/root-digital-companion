  howToWin: 'Score victory points by flipping your plot tokens. The more plots you already have face-up, the more points you score for flipping the next one.',
  howToPlay: 'The Corvid Conspiracy is a faction of spies and saboteurs focused on bluffing and misdirection. Your core gameplay loop involves placing face-down Plot tokens on the map, then flipping them with a warrior present to score points and trigger an effect. The scoring is exponential; the more plots already face-up, the more points the next one scores. Your opponents can try to foil your plans with "Exposure"â€”if an enemy in a clearing with your face-down plot shows you a matching card, they can guess the plot type. If they\'re right, they score a point and remove your plot. If they\'re wrong, you take their card! You have four plot types: Bombs that wipe out enemies, Snares that trap them, Raids that let you pop up elsewhere, and Extortion that steals cards.',
  strategy: 'Your entire game is about mind games. Place plots in locations that are most threatening to your opponents. A Bomb plot in their most valuable clearing forces them to either risk an Exposure or move out. A Snare can lock down a key path. Since you score for *each* face-up plot when you flip a new one, your scoring can explode in the late game. Use your Nimble ability to move warriors into position to flip plots. Your "Embedded Agents" ability makes enemies think twice about attacking you, as they\'ll take an extra hit if you have a face-down plot in the clearing.',
