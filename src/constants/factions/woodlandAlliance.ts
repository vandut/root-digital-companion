  tagline: 'Rebellion. Gain the sympathy of the oppressed creatures of the woodland and incite a revolt.',
  howToWin: 'Score victory points by spreading Sympathy across the map. The more Sympathy tokens on the map, the more points you score when you place the next one.',
  mechanics: 'The Alliance has several unique components. Supporters are a secret stack of cards you build by using the Mobilize action; these cards are the currency for your most powerful actions. Sympathy tokens are your primary way of scoring and establishing a board presence. You spend supporters to place them, with the cost increasing based on the number of enemy warriors in the target clearing. Bases are your strongholds, established by using the powerful Revolt action in a sympathetic clearing. Each of the three bases (Fox, Rabbit, Mouse) allows you to Train Officers. Officers are your military action points for the Evening. Finally, your Guerilla War ability reverses battle rolls when you are defending, making you a formidable opponent to attack.',
  howToPlay: 'The Woodland Alliance operates in the shadows, building a grassroots rebellion. You start with no pieces on the map, focusing first on gathering cards into your Supporters stack. From there, you begin to Spread Sympathy, which scores points and sets the stage for future actions. Your big move is the Revolt, which removes all enemy pieces in a clearing and establishes a permanent Base. Bases allow you to train Officers, which in turn let you take military actions like Move and Battle in the Evening. You are a guerrilla force, strong on defense and capable of sudden, explosive uprisings.',
  strategy: 'Your early game is about gaining supporters and spreading sympathy to unpopular clearings (those with lots of enemy pieces) to trigger "Outrage" and get free supporters from other players. Avoid direct conflict until you are ready. Choose your revolt locations carefully; a well-placed base in a central, easily-defended clearing can secure a region and give you a new front for training and military operations. Your hand size is your lifebloodâ€”more cards mean more supporters, so protect clearings where you can gain card advantage.',

If they can\'t, they must show you their hand, and you draw a card from the deck. This is a key source of supporters.' },
