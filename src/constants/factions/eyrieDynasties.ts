  howToWin: 'Score victory points each Evening based on the number of Roosts on the map. The more Roosts you have, the more points you score.',
  howToPlay: 'The Eyrie Dynasties are a high-risk, high-reward faction governed by the Decree, a rigid set of actions they must perform every turn. Each turn, you must add one or two cards to the Decree, expanding the list of mandatory actions. During Daylight, you must resolve every single card in the Decree, from left to right. If you fail to perform any action fully, you fall into Turmoilâ€”a catastrophic event where you lose points, your leader is deposed, and your Decree is wiped clean. Your goal is to build and protect Roosts, as they determine your VP score in the evening. Your choice of leader dictates your starting Decree and a special ability, shaping your strategy for that reign.',
  strategy: 'Success with the Eyrie is all about managing the Decree. Plan your turns far in advance. Don\'t get greedy; adding too many cards to make your Decree impossible to fulfill, leading to Turmoil. Bird cards are a double-edged sword: they can be used for any suit, making your Decree flexible, but they also cost you more victory points if you fall into Turmoil. Sometimes, a planned Turmoil can be a strategic way to reset a failing Decree and switch to a more suitable leader. Your special ability, "Lords of the Forest," is incredibly powerful for establishing rule, so use it to your advantage to build Roosts in contested clearings.',
