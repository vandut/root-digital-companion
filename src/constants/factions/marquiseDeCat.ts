  tagline: 'Engine of War. Rule the woods by building a massive, interconnected economy.',
  howToWin: 'Score victory points by building Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters. The more of a single building type you have, the more points the next one will be worth.',
  howToPlay: 'The Marquise de Cat plays a straightforward engine-building game. Your entire strategy revolves around wood. You build Sawmills to produce wood, and then spend that wood on other buildings to score points and improve your actions. Workshops allow you to craft, and Recruiters increase your board presence. The Keep is your fortress; you can only place warriors there through Field Hospitals, making it a vital defensive stronghold. Your power grows steadily as you build more and more, leading to an explosive late-game scoring potential if your economic engine is left unchecked.',
  strategy: 'Your opening move is critical. Establish your Sawmills early to start wood production. Protect these supply lines at all costs; an enemy who cuts off your wood supply can cripple your game. Use your large number of warriors to bully other factions and secure clearings for building. Don\'t neglect craftingâ€”the Marquise can craft powerful cards that can swing the game. Your biggest challenge is your slow start. You need to survive the early game to build up your unstoppable industrial machine.',
