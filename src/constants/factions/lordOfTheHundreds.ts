  type: 'Militant',
  tagline: 'Warlord of the Wastes. Rule through fear and overwhelming force, scoring points by oppressing clearings.',
  howToWin: 'Score points in the Evening by Oppressing the woodlandâ€”ruling clearings that contain your pieces and no enemy pieces. The more such clearings you rule, the more points you score.',
  howToPlay: 'The Lord of the Hundreds is a hyper-aggressive warlord faction. You are led by a powerful Warlord piece who is central to your actions. Your abilities are fueled by your Hoard of items; the more items you have, the more actions you can take (Command) and the more powerful your Warlord becomes (Prowess). Each turn you select a new Mood, a temporary ability that shapes your strategy. You score points by aggressively clearing out enemies and establishing total dominance over clearings. You can also spend cards to Incite Mobs, which will Raze enemy buildings and tokens at the start of your next turn.',
  strategy: 'Aggression is your only path. Use your Warlord to lead the charge with the Advance action. Your early game should focus on looting items from ruins or other players to power up your Hoard, which directly increases your number of actions. Choose your Mood carefully to counter your opponents or press your advantage. The Incite action is powerful for softening up well-defended clearings before your main attack. Your goal is to create a large, contiguous territory free of enemies to maximize your Oppress scoring each evening.',
