  tagline: 'Fanatical Proselytizers. Convert the outcasts of the woodland and spread your gospel through overwhelming conviction.',
  howToWin: 'Score victory points primarily by performing the Score ritual in Daylight. The more Gardens of a certain suit you have, the more points you score when you spend a card of that suit.',
  mechanics: 'The Cult\'s actions are dictated by the discard pile, known as the Lost Souls. The most numerous suit in the Lost Souls at the start of your turn becomes the Outcast suit. This suit determines where you can perform powerful Conspiracy actions, which are fueled by Acolytes. You gain Acolytes primarily through your Revenge ability when your warriors are removed on defense. Your Daylight phase is spent performing Rituals by revealing cards from your hand. For each card revealed, you get one action (Build, Recruit, or Score). You only spend the card if you perform the Score ritual, making hand management crucial. Your buildings, Gardens, have a special property called Pilgrims, which makes you rule any clearing where you have a garden, a massive advantage for controlling the board.',
  howToPlay: 'The Lizard Cult is a faction that thrives on careful planning. You must pay close attention to what cards you are discarding to manipulate the Outcast suit to your advantage. You are weak in battle, so use your "Revenge" ability to your advantageâ€”losing defenders gives you acolytes for powerful conspiracies. Your "Pilgrims" ability is one of the strongest in the game; a single garden lets you rule a clearing. Use this to block other factions from building and moving.',
  strategy: 'Your goal is to manipulate the "Outcast" suit to be a suit where you have established a presence and can build gardens, allowing you to score big. In the early game, carefully manage your hand to discard cards of the suit you need to become the Outcast. Your most powerful Conspiracy is Sanctify, which lets you replace an enemy building with a garden, a huge swing in board state and points. Your scoring is slow but can accelerate dramatically if you build many gardens of the same suit and can make that suit the Outcast.',
